<h2>The Poem Problem</h2>
<p>In HTML, spaces and new lines are ignored:</p>
<p>
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  My Bonnie lies over the sea.

  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
  
  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</p>

<h2>Solution - The HTML &lt;pre&gt; Element</h2>
<p>The pre tag preserves both spaces and line breaks:</p>
<pre>
   My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

   My Bonnie lies over the sea.

   My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
   
   Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
